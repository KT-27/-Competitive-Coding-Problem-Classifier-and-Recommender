multisets {a, a, b} and {a, b, b} are different.you have a set consisting of some elements. a set can either be empty, or contain other sets. note that sets in this problem may contain multiple copies of the same set. more formally, a set satisfies the following context free grammar with start symbol s:s -&gt; {t}t -&gt; st | εin this context free grammar, s denotes a set, while t denotes a list of the elements which are sets themselves. for example, valid sets are {}, {{}}, {{}{}}, {{}{{}{}}}.we can define an element of a set to be one of the sets that make up the set.
for example, a set {a, a, b} has three elements, that is a, a, and b.
the set {} has no elements. the set {{}} has one element {}. the set {{}{{}{}}} has two elements {}, {{}{}}.two sets are said to the same if they have the same multiset of elements. note that the order of elements in the sets doesn't matter. for example, the sets {{}{{}}} and {{{}}{}} are the same, but the sets {{}{}} and {{}} are different.call a set stransitiveif x is an element of s, then all elements in x are elements of s as well.for example, the empty set {} is transitive. the set {{}} is also transitive. however, the set s = {{{}}} is not transitive, as {{}} is an element of s, but {} is an element of {{}} but not of s. we can make it transitive by adding the element {} to the set to get the transitive set {{{}}{}}.you’re given a string withncharacters representing a set. you would like to make this set transitive with the minimum number of moves. in one move, you can either add an arbitrary set or remove an arbitrary element from s.  you are not allowed to add or remove elements in sets that are elements of s. compute the minimum number moves you need to make the set transitive.the first line of the input will contain an integert, denoting the number of test cases.each test case will contain a single string on its own line, denoting the set.print a single line per test case, the minimum number of moves required to make the set transitive.for all files1 ≤t≤ 102 ≤nthe set described by the string is valid.file 1 --33pts:n≤ 10file 2 --27pts:n≤ 50file 3 --25pts:n≤ 100file 4 --15pts:n≤ 20,000","In the first sample, the set is already transitive, so we don't need to do anything.In the second sample, we can add the set {} to make the set transitive.In the third sample, we can remove both elements {{{{}}}} and {{{{}}}} to get an empty set, which is transitive.In the fourth sample, this set has elements {}, {{{}{}}{{}}}, {{}{}}, {{{{}{}}{}}}. Note that we can only add or remove elements from the outermost set. Although we can get a transitive set by modifying the second set to {{{}{}}{}} this operation cannot be done in a single move.

his favorite kind of graphs to play with are trees.
a tree is a connected graph with no cycles.recently, he defined a new structure in a tree and called it astickman. astickmanis a set of 7 different vertices and 6 different edges. vertices should be connected by edges as in the image below.you can see here two legs, two arms and a head. formally, one vertex must be connected to four other vertices and one of these four must be connected to two more vertices.lukas had a tree ofnvertices (numbered1throughn) and he used to count distinctstickmenin that tree.
astickmanis defined by a set of vertices and edges and their order doesn't matter.
so, twostickmenare distinct only if some vertex or some edge belongs to exactly one of the twostickmen.however, one day a mischievous bear stole lukas' tree. now lukas doesn't remember what his tree looked like. all he remembers is the degree of every vertex of the tree.
he is sure that the degree of the vertexiwas equal todi.he has no other choice than to assume that his tree was a random tree satisfying the conditions he remembers.
more formally, let's consider the setsof all distinct trees ofnvertices (numbered1throughn) satisfying those conditions.
two trees are distinct only if there are two vertices connected by an edge in exactly one of the two trees.
limak assumes now that each tree inshas equal probability to be his beloved tree.note: it is guaranteed that there is at least one tree with the given degrees. so, the described setsisn't empty.after the loss lukas is too sad to do anything so he asks you to find the expected number ofstickmenin his tree. find the answer and print it modulo109+7. read the ""output format"" section for more details.the first line contains a single integern, denoting the number of vertices in the tree.the next line containsnintegersd1, d2, ..., dn.if the answer is equal to 0, print 0 in a single line.otherwise, it can be proved that for given constraints the answer can be uniquely written as a fractionp/qsatisfying conditions:1)pandqare positive integers2)pandqare relatively prime (sop/qis an irreducible fraction)3)qis not divisible by109+7your task is to find the value ofp * q-1modulo109+7.
