VD1. Magic Powder - 1\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aThis problem is given in two versions that differ only by constraints. If you can solve this problem in large constraints, then you can just write a single solution to the both versions. If you find the problem too difficult in large constraints, you can write solution to the simplified version only.\u000aWaking up in the morning, Apollinaria decided to bake cookies. To bake one cookie, she needs n ingredients, and for each ingredient she knows the value ai \u2014 how many grams of this ingredient one needs to bake a cookie. To prepare one cookie Apollinaria needs to use all n ingredients.\u000aApollinaria has bi gram of the i-th ingredient. Also she has k grams of a magic powder. Each gram of magic powder can be turned to exactly 1 gram of any of the n ingredients and can be used for baking cookies.\u000aYour task is to determine the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria is able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20091000) \u2014 the number of ingredients and the number of grams of the magic powder.\u000aThe second line contains the sequence a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u20091000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, needed to bake one cookie.\u000aThe third line contains the sequence b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bn (1\u2009\u2264\u2009bi\u2009\u2264\u20091000), where the i-th number is equal to the number of grams of the i-th ingredient, which Apollinaria has.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the maximum number of cookies, which Apollinaria will be able to bake using the ingredients that she has and the magic powder.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a3 1\u000a2 1 4\u000a11 3 16\u000aoutput\u000a4\u000ainput\u000a4 3\u000a4 3 5 6\u000a11 12 14 20\u000aoutput\u000a3\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample it is profitably for Apollinaria to make the existing 1 gram of her magic powder to ingredient with the index 2, then Apollinaria will be able to bake 4 cookies.\u000aIn the second sample Apollinaria should turn 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 1 and 1 gram of magic powder to ingredient with the index 3. Then Apollinaria will be able to bake 3 cookies. The remaining 1 gram of the magic powder can be left, because it can't be used to increase the answer.
