For convenience, we enumerate all languages of the world with integers from 1 to 109.\u000aIn the evening after the conference, all n scientists decided to go to the cinema. There are m movies in the cinema they came to. Each of the movies is characterized by two distinct numbers \u2014 the index of audio language and the index of subtitles language. The scientist, who came to the movie, will be very pleased if he knows the audio language of the movie, will be almost satisfied if he knows the language of subtitles and will be not satisfied if he does not know neither one nor the other (note that the audio language and the subtitles language for each movie are always different).\u000aScientists decided to go together to the same movie.
